Dynamic hash table implementation based on article in CACM April 1988 pp.
446-457, by Per-Ake Larson.

This implementation was based on a 3/7/1989 submission to comp.sources.misc by
Esmond Pitt (ejp@ausmelb.oz.AU) that emulated the hsearch(3) interface. The interface
was reworked to be much more flexible and significant new functionality was
added by John Dennis (jdennis@sharpeye.com).

A hash table maintains a set of <key,value> pairs. Lookups are performed by
locating the key in the table and returning its value.

A dynamic hash table keeps the number of hash collisions constant
independent of the number of entries in the hash table.

Both keys and values may be of different types. Two different key types are
supported, strings and unsigned longs. If the key type is a string the hash
library will automatically allocate memory to hold the hash key string and
will automatically free the memory for the key string when the hash entry
is destroyed. Items in the hash table only match when their key types match
AND the keys themselves match. For example if there were two hash entries,
one whose key type was an unsigned long equal to 1 and one whose key type was
a string equal to "1" they would not match, these are considered two
distinct entries.

The value of the key may be a undefined, pointer, an int, an unsigned int, a
long, an unsigned long, a float, or a double. The hash library does nothing
with user pointers (value.type == HASH_VALUE_PTR). Its the user responsibility
to free items pointed to by these pointers when a hash entry is deleted or the
hash table is destroyed (see hash_delete_callback and/or hash_destroy).

See dhash_example.c for an illustration of how one might use the API. It does not
represent complete API coverage nor the optimal way to do things in all cases,
it is just a general example.

 * may have as many concurrent hash tables as you want.

 * If the table creation is successful tbl is set to the new table and
 * HASH_SUCCESS is returned, otherwise tbl will be set to NULL and the
 * return value will be a HASH error code.
 *
 * count
 *     Expected number of entries in the table. This is a tuning
 *     parameter because a dynamic hash table dynamically adjusts it's
 *     internal data strucuture to optimize for the actual number of
 *     entries. The count parameter allows for some more optimization,
 *     however it's not critical to get it right, the table will still
 *     perform well. If you have no idea of how many entries to expect
 *     then pass 0, a reasonable default will be selected.
 * tbl
 *     Pointer to a hash_table_t variable which is initialized to the
 *     new hash table (i.e. the returned table). If the table fails to
 *     be created due to errors the tbl parameter will be set to NULL
 *     and the return value will be a HASH error code.
 * delete_callback
 *     Pointer to a function which will be called just prior to a hash
 *     entry being deleted. This is useful when the hash value has
 *     items which may need to be disposed of. The delete_callback may
 *     be NULL.
 * delete_private_data

 *     callbacks can have a private context to reach data they need to
 *     use before performning their operations. delete_private_data
 *     may be NULL.
