1. Overview by exmaple
##########################################################################
The LuoYun Cloud platform applications are developed with GNU Auto tools.
So it follows standard source code building procedures.

Assuming all the source files have been copied/downloaded into the current
directory, and both controler server and node server are to be installed
under /opt/LuoYun/platform, the build commands are,
[dongwu@localhost platform]$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/LuoYun/platform
[dongwu@localhost platform]$ make
[dongwu@localhost platform]$ sudo make install
Password: 
[dongwu@localhost platform]$

Assuming the machine is used as the cloud controller, 
[dongwu@localhost platform]$ sudo /opt/LuoYun/platform/bin/lyclc

Assuming the same machine is used as the node server as well,
[dongwu@localhost platform]$ sudo /opt/LuoYun/platform/bin/lynode

Now a Single Machine Deployment of LuoYunCloud platform is up and ready to
serve the request from LuoYunCloud web server.

2. Install details
##########################################################################

Here are the defails of building LuoYunCloud applications from
source code, assuming the source files are ready in the current directory.

2.1  The first step is to run the configure script, which can be as
     simple as

     ./configure

     However, it's recommeneded to specify a prefix so that when doing
     "make install", all the files are installed into the specified 
     directory. Developers in LuoYun Co. use the following command

     ./configure --prefix=/opt/LuoYun/platform

2.2  The second step is quite straightforward, just run "make"

     make

2.3  The third step is to install the applications and supporting files,

     make install

     If you have specified "prefix" in the first step, all the files will
     be installed to the specified directory. Otherwise, the files will be
     installed to directories per Linux standard, for example, executables
     will be installed into /usr/local/bin, config files go to /etc, etc.

     When /opt/LuoYun/platform is used as install prefix, all the resulting
     files are as follows,
     [dongwu@localhost platform]$ find /opt/LuoYun/platform
     /opt/LuoYun/platform
     /opt/LuoYun/platform/bin
     /opt/LuoYun/platform/bin/lyclc
     /opt/LuoYun/platform/bin/lynode
     /opt/LuoYun/platform/etc
     /opt/LuoYun/platform/etc/luoyun-cloud
     /opt/LuoYun/platform/etc/luoyun-cloud/lyclc.conf
     /opt/LuoYun/platform/etc/luoyun-cloud/lynode.conf
     [dongwu@localhost platform]$ 

     Among all the files installed, only the two binary excutables are
     needed. Other files, including configuration files can be omitted if
     all the default settings are to be used. The default settings should
     work in most cases.

     lyclc  - this is the Cloud Controller application. Along with the
              LuoYunCloud Web Server, it needs to be installed on
              a machine which is designated to control LuoYunCloud platform.

     lynode - this is the Node Server application. It needs to be installed
              on a physical machine that supports virtualization. Currently
              only KVM is supported.

3. Deployment
##########################################################################

3.1 Deployment on single machine

LuoYunCloud software work well on a single machine. The commands listed in
Overview section are the example of setting up LuoYunCloud platform on a
single machine.

The machine needs to have KVM properly configured. And it's suggested to
use RHEL6/CentOS6, or the compliant Linux distribution, as the OS running
on the machine.

To deploy LuoYun Cloud platform on another machine, simply copy the
lyclc and lynode binary executables onto the other machine and start
them with root privilege.

3.2 Deployment on multiple machines

While deploying LuoYun Cloud platform onto multiple machines, one and only
one machine needs to be designated as Cloud Controller. Although a virtual
machine can be used as Cloud Controller, for the purpose of performance,
it's recommended to use a physical machine.

To set up the Cloud Controller machine,
  1) Start and configure postgresql DB per requirement from LuoYunCloud
     Web Server.
  2) In default configuration, lyclc registers each node server
     automatically by multicasting register request through multicast
     IP adddress 228.0.0.1. If defautl settings are used, make sure
     iptables is disabled or network traffic destined to 228.0.0.1
     is allowed.
  3) Copy the lyclc binary executable onto the machine and start it with
     root privilege. RHEL5/6 and their compliant Linux diestributions are
     well tested. If non-default settings are used, copy the configuration
     file as well. It's recommended to copy both the binary executable
     and configuration file to default location(specified by --prefix
     option in configure).

LuoYun Cloud platform can be easily expanded to include more physical
machines as node server. To set up a node server,
  1) Configure KVM and enable bridge mode. Make sure full-virtualization
     virtual machine can be created with KVM.
  2) In default configuration, lynode registers to cloud controller
     automatically by listening on multicast IP adddress 228.0.0.1 for
     register request. If defautl settings are used, make sure
     iptables is disabled or network traffic destined to 228.0.0.1
     is allowed.
  3) Copy the lynode binary executable onto the machine and start it with 
     root privilege. RHEL6/CentOS6 and its compliant Linux diestributions
     have good support for KVM and are well tested. If non-default
     settings are used, copy the configuration file as well. It's
     recommended to copy both the binary executable and configuration file
     to default location(specified by --prefix option in configure).

3.3 Deployment on instances(virtual machine)

Note: lyosm is obsoleted, replaced by pyosm, see osmanager directory on the
      top level directory of LuoYunCloud project

In other to manage instances effectively in LuoYunCloud platform, it's 
desired to have each instance installed with OS manager and started
automatically when the instance gets started. All instances developed by
LuoYun have OS manager pre-installed and configured. See LuoYunCloud
Instance Devleopment Guide for more details.



Enjoy!
