The purpose of os mananger is to allow better control of instance in the cloud.
Also, since os manager runs in the instance, it's decided to use python to 
implement os manager so that it can be easily modified to fit instance's need.

1. OS Manager Explanation

LuoYun Cloud passes instance runtime configuration through instance's floppy
disk. Script osmanager.sh is the entry point of OS manager. It reads 
configuration data from floppy and copy it to a standard location, which is
/LuoYun/conf/luoyun.conf. It then starts various components of OS manager.

Currently, there are four main components in OS mamanger. These components
are under bin/ directory.

pyosc	- pyosc configures essential system settings such as root password,
          root ssh key, network interface address and name server.

pyweb	- pyweb runs after instance network interface is properly set up
          and enabled. Currently pyweb starts a simple HTTP server and serves
          simple web pages for the instance. The web pages are under
          custom/www directory.

pyosm	- pyosm runs after instance network interface is properly set up
          and enabled. Based on information provided by instance
          configuration file, it registers the instance in LuoYun cloud
          and maintains the connection as long as the instance is in running
          state. Currently, pyosm also periodically runs 'status' script
          that's under custom/scripts directory. The 'status' command 
          currently tells Cloud Controller whether pyweb is properly running.

webssh	- webssh runs after instance network interface is properly set up
          and enabled. Instance owner can also choose to not run the webssh
          client when instance gets started. The control option is given on
          LuoYun Cloud Web interface.

Under top level directory of OS Manager, there's a custom/ subdirectory. All
the files under custom/ directory are subject to change while installing OS
Manager in appliance. The files under custom/ are used by other components
of OS manager. 

2. OS Manager Installation

Here are the steps to install os manager in instance,
1) Create top level OS Manager in instance root file system. Typically,
   /LuoYun is used.
2) Copy all the files/directories into the directory created above. Typically,
   it is /LuoYun. Please notice that webssh requires Shell-in-a-box executable
   binary shellinaboxd to be under /LuoYun/bin/webssh. The pre-built binary
   file can be obtained in OS Manager installation package on LuoYun company
   web site luoyun.co.
3) Create build/ subdirectory under /LuoYun in instance, and create following
   regular text files under build/
   BASE: info about instance base OS
   BUILD: build info about instance
   CHANGELOG: chnagelog of instance
   PACKAGES: list of packages installed in instance
   VERSION: the version of instance and the version of main application
            installed in instance
   Currently, only file VERSION is used by pyweb to build the web pages served
   by pyweb, all the other files are optional.
4) Review and modify files under /LuoYun/custom/ directory.
   /LuoYun/custom/www - contains files used by pyweb. These files should be
                        modified with information specific to the application
                        installed in instance.
   /LuoYun/custom/scrtips/config - is the file used to configure application.
                                   It's invoked by osmanager.sh.
5) Review mand modify osmanager.sh when neceassry.
6) For system that doesn't support init scripts, run /LuoYun/install.sh to
   start OS Manager automatically when instance gets started. For systems that
   support init scripts, such as Centos6+, scripts in init/luoyun directory
   will be picked up and run automatically by system's init process.

While installing OS Manager in appliance, make sure stop 5 above is done in
chroot or similar environment.

3. Uninstall OS Manager
1) Run /LuoYun/uninstall.sh and remove /etc/init/luoyun
2) Remove whole directory of /LuoYun
