The purpose of os mananger is to allow better control of instance in the cloud.
Also, since os manager runs in the instance, it's decided to use python to 
implement os manager so that it can be easily modified to fit instance's need.

Currently, there are four components in OS mamanger,

pyosc	- pyosc runs as soon as instance root file system is mounted. 
          It reads instance configuration info that's provided by the cloud,
          and saves the info to a standard location for other cs manager
          components to use. Currently, the standard instance configuration
          file location is /LuoYun/conf/luoyun.conf.
          pyosc also configures basic system info such as root password,
          root ssh key and network interface address.

pyosm	- pyosm runs after instance network interface is properly set up
          and enabled. Based on information provided by instance
          configuration file, it registers the instance in LuoYun cloud
          and maintains the connection as long as the instance is in running
          state. Currently, pyosm also periodically runs 'status' command
          that's under scripts directory. From the 'status' command result,
          it tells Cloud Controller whether lyweb is properly running.

pyweb	- pyweb runs after instance network interface is properly set up
          and enabled. Currently pyweb starts a simple HTTP server and serves
          simple web pages for the instance.

webssh	- webssh runs after instance network interface is properly set up
          and enabled. Instance owner can also choose to not run the webssh
          client when instance gets started. The control option is given in
          instance configuration file.

Here are the steps to install os manager in instance,
1. Create /LuoYun/bin directory in instance, and copy pyosc, pyosm, pyweb, and
   webssh directories into /LuoYun/bin/. Modify index.html files under
   /LuoYun/bin/pyweb/data/ to provide instance specific information.
2. Create /LuoYun/build directory in instance, and create following regular
   text files under /LuoYun/build
   BASE: info about instance base OS
   BUILD: build info about instance
   CHANGELOG: chnagelog of instance
   PACKAGES: list of packages installed in instance
   VERSION: the version of instance and the version of main application
            installed in instance
   Currently, file VERSION is used by pyweb to build the web pages served
   by pyweb.
3. Create empty directory of /LuoYun/conf and /LuoYun/log. Both directories
   are used by os manager.
4. Copy scripts directory under /LuoYun and modify the scripts/status file
   when neccessary.

OS manager is also typically installed in appliance so that the related
instances can be automatically managed through LuoYun Cloud Web interface.
