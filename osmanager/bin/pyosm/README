Files in this directory are Python implementation of OS manager, which is
used by some LuoYun Virtual Appliance. OS manager allows better control for
the appliance through cloud.

The typical use of OS manager is as follows,
1. Inside appliance, make sure iptables is turned off. If iptables has to be
   turned on, please make sure multicast packets to 228.0.0.1/1369 is allowed
   to be received by the appliance.

2. In the root file system of an appliance, create the following directories
/LuoYun/bin
/LuoYun/bin/pyosm
/LuoYun/conf
/LuoYun/log
/LuoYun/scripts

3. Copy all the Python files in this directory to /LuoYun/bin/pyosm

4. Start OS manager with the following command, as root
# python /LuoYun/bin/pyosm/lyosm.py &

The above invocation of lyosm.py will use default configuration settings that
built into the lyosm.py code. The default settings are,

/LuoYun/conf/luoyun.conf - default cloud configuration file location, the file
                           is provided by the cloud
/LuoYun/log/luoyun.log   - default log file location, the file will created
                           by lyosm.py
/LuoYun/scripts          - default directory where appliance related scripts
                           are stored. It's not neccessary to provide
                           appliance scripts. However, if a script named
                           "status" exists in the directory, lyosm.py will
                           run the "status" script periodically to check
                           status of the web application running in the
                           appliance and report result to cloud controller.

The above settings, along with other command options, can be changed on 
commad line of lyosm.py.
